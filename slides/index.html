<aside class="notes">
    <ul>
        <li>Engineering and product owner focused, but has value for everyone.</li>
        <li>This is review if you've done Scrum elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Very unusual for us to NOT have adopted the backlog organizationally. Not quite fly by the seat of your pants, but close.</li>
        <li>Inarguably, most important artifact in Scrum.</li>
        <li>Mystery Men have been using a backlog with great success.</li>
        <li>Outline:
            <ul>
                <li>Introduce (or reintroduce) the product backlog
                <li>Show its benefits</li>
                <li>Help get you started on your own backlog</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
